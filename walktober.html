									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p>Walktober is an annual event held at Portland State University's Rec Center where they challenge participants to walk 10,000 steps every day in the month of October. The program requires software that allows participants to log their daily steps and admins to view who has won the incentives. In the past, the software that they used was either expensive or difficult to use.</p>

									<p>My frontend team worked together with a backend team to create a website and mobile application that accomplishes everything the Rec Center needs to implement this program. Users can sign up, log in, enter their steps manually, connect their smart wactches to log steps automatically, view their position in the leaderboard, create a new team, join an existing team, view the teams' leaderboard, chat with all participants, chat with just their team members, and view a bar graph detailing the steps they've taken in the last week. Admins can do all of this, plus see a table of all users and their total steps, see a table of all teams and their total steps, export the user data, export the team data, export the survey data, change the event settings, change the team settings, and post announcements to the group chat.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Tech Specs</h3>
									<p>In order to achieve all the necessary features in a compressed timeline, we opted to use Ionic, which is an open-source framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. This allowed us to develop the website and mobile application simultaneously. We used Firebase's database and hosting services. For the chats, we embedded discord servers.</p>
